# Chemistry-Software-Python2
The "front-end" files of this project are stoichiometry_DIY.py, molar_calculator.py, and pc_and_formula_calculator.py. Respectively, the programs do the following: solving a chemical quantity given the quantity of another chemical and the ratio between the two, converting between moles, grams, and molecules of a given compound, and converting between percent composition and various chemical formulae. The rest of the files just contain functions and data required to make everything work, so only run the three above programs.
