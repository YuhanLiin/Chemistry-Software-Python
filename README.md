# Chemistry-Software-Python2
A series of programs written in Python 2 for digitally handling the tedious stoichiometric calculation I had to do in Gr 11. Chemistry. The large volumes of output ensure coverage of most problem types. These are likely the only programs to actually be of any use to me in real life, as they made Chem homework a breeze.
