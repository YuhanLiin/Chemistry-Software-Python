# Chemistry-Software-Python2
A series of programs written in Python 2 for digitally handling the tedious stoichiometric calculation I had to do in Gr 11. Chemistry. The large volumes of output ensure coverage of most problem types. These are likely the only programs I've made to actually be of any use to me in real life, as they made Chem homework a breeze. The "front-end" files of this project are stoichiometry_DIY.py, molar_calculator.py, and pc_and_formula_calculator.py. The rest of them just contain functions and data required to make sure everything works, so only run those three programs.
